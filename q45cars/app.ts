//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always
// receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.
// Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
